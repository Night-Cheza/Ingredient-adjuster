This app is created to help with adjustment of called for a particular recipe ingredients when having one of the ingredients less than is needed or if a user would like to use more of a particular ingredient than is needed.

May 09, 2024:
The app can take an input from a user and display it. Also it recalculates amount of required ingredients according to a change in the amount of one of the ingredients.
	Doesn't display recalculated recipe
	Allows change in measurement and disregards it in calculations
	No styling

June 18, 2024: rework code to add edit button on 'done' button instead of having input fields to enter an ingredient to adjust recipe to
June 26, 2024:
	Initial functionality for the app is done:
		- the app takes an input from a user and displays it
		- allows a user to edit an amount of one ingredient. No changes in measurement allowed right now.
		- displays recalculated recipe according to changes done by user
		- no styling

Next: styling, error handling, and refining recalculation of the ingredients

In the future:
	- taking measurement in account for recalculations
	- suggestion dowgrade or upgrade of the measurement when recalculating amount of the ingredient where necessary
