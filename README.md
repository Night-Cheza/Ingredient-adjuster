This app is created to help with adjustment of called for a particular recipe ingredients when having one of the ingredients less that is needed or would like to use it more that is needed.

May 09, 2024:
The app can take an input from a user and display it. Also it recalculates amount of required ingredients according to a change in the amount of one of the ingredients.
	Doesn't display recalculated recipe
	Allows change in measurement and disregards it in calculations
	No styling

June 18: rework code to add edit button on 'done' button instead of having input fields to enter an ingredient to adjust recipe to
June 26: initial functionality for the app is done

Next: styling and refining recalculation of the ingredients

In the future:
	- taking measurement in account for recalculations
	- suggestion dowgrade or upgrade of the measurement when recalculating amount of the ingredient where necessary
